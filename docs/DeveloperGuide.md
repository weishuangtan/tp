# Developer Guide

## Introduction

Trippie is a command-line app to plan any of your upcoming trips. It is tailored to match the needs of student travellers. Trippie lets users plan multiple trips through timetabling and also allows users to track their expenses overseas. Trippie is designed for users to enter their input quickly and efficiently.

## Setting up the project in your computer

**Prerequisites:**
* JDK 11
* IntelliJ IDE

⚠ **Caution:**

Follow the steps in the following guide precisely. Things will not work out if you deviate in some steps.
</div>

First, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):
1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 11**.
1. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA.<br>
  :exclamation: Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
1. **Verify the setup**:
   1. Run the `seedu.trippie.Trippie` and try a few commands.
   2. [Run the tests](Testing.md) to ensure they all pass. 

## Design & Implementation

This section explains the high-level design of the application. Given below is an overview of each component and a more detailed explanation of the architecture. Trippie is the main class which manages the initialization of the relevant classes and their execution.

### Architecture

Figure 4 above shows the various exception classes used to handle the different errors met.

**`Trippie`** has one class called [`Trippie`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trippie/Trippie.java?) It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of three components.
- **UI** : The UI of the App.
- **Parser** : Parses user input and its information to respective commands.
- **Storage** : Reads data from, and write data to, the text file.
- **Command** : Executes each command respectively.

The Sequence diagram below shows how the program flows across the different classes when parsing or executing user commands.
